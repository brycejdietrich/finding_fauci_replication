# This folder contains all the data necessary to replicate the figures/tables in the main text and Appendix of "Finding Fauci."

Please see "code" directory for all necessary code. Also, the tableSX_results.csv files are created by the tableSX_results.R files in the aforementioned directory. If you cloned the repository, you do not need to run the R code again. Instead, you can jump straight to the do-files.
