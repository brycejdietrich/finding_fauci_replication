# Replication Data for "Finding Fauci: How Visual and Textual Information Varied on Cable News Networks During the Covid-19 Pandemic"

The "code" folder contains the R/STATA code needed to replicate the figures and tables in the main text and SI. For Tables S3-S10, we used STATA, but the initial data manipulation was done in R. All other tables/figures were created in R. Please see "output" folder for expected figure/table. All data needed to replicate the figures/tables can be found in the "data" folder. Questions/comments can be sent to brycedietrich@gmail.com
